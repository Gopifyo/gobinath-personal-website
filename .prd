# PRD: VibeOS - Gobinath Portfolio Interface

## 1. Project Vision
VibeOS is a premium, high-performance personal portfolio designed to present Gobinath as a "Vibe Coder" and Bioengineer. It bridges the gap between scientific rigor (Biotech) and modern digital experiences (Agentic AI/Social UX).

## 2. Core Personas
- **Target Audience**: High-end tech recruiters, Biotech VCs, AI researchers, and collaborators.
- **The Brand**: "Bioengineer. Vibe Coder. Founder."

## 3. Design Philosophy
- **Aesthetic**: "Terminal-Chic" / "Cyber-Lab". Uses slate-950 backgrounds with lime-400 (Biotech) and sky-400 (AI) highlights.
- **UX Pattern**: Operating System (OS) metaphor. A desktop launcher leads to a chat-centric "Vault" experience.
- **Vibe**: High-energy, professional, and automated.

## 4. Feature Set
- **Desktop Launcher**: Immersive entrance with dynamic background animations.
- **Agentic Chat**: A Gemini-powered "Vibe Agent" that serves as the primary navigation and information retriever.
- **Component Modules**:
    - **Vault (Gallery)**: Visual proof of lab and tech work.
    - **Protocols (Experience)**: Structured professional history.
    - **Modules (Projects)**: Showcase of agentic AI and mobile products.
    - **Archives (Publications/Patents)**: Peer-reviewed validation of scientific impact.
- **Knowledge Sync**: Ability for users to "sync" their own portrait for a personalized feel.

## 5. Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons.
- **AI**: Google Gemini API (@google/genai) using `gemini-3-flash-preview`.
- **State**: React Hooks with local storage persistence for "Protocol Identity" (profile images).

## 6. Success Metrics
- Seamless image loading from the `gallery/` root folder.
- Zero-latency feel in UI transitions (Framer-like animations).
- High engagement with the "Vibe Agent" chat interface.
