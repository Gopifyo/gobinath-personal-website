Animal testing is simply part of the mainstream when it comes to experimentation for things that may one day be put into humans as medical devices. Stents are one particular example whereby a lattice tube is often put into tubes within the human body, such as arteries, to make sure they remain open allowing blood to flow more freely.

But what if we could remove the need for animal testing by devising a plant-based solution to tissue scaffolds? Belonging to a collaborative team, Oregon State University researcher Gobinath Chithiravelu under the guidance of PI, Binata Joddar, Associate Professor for Bioengineering in CBEE, has found a viable solution to this ethical problem: seaweed. ScienceVega met up with him on behalf of this team to discuss both his discovery, and the implications for laboratory mice.

**ScienceVega: To start, can you give us a little background on tissue scaffolds? What are they made of, and what are they used for?**

**GC:** Tissue scaffolds are three-dimensional structures designed to support cell growth and organisation in the lab. Essentially, they act as temporary templates that guide tissue formation. These scaffolds closely mimic the extracellular matrix, the natural environment in our bodies that provides structural support and biological cues for cells.

As for their composition, scaffolds can be made from a variety of materials. There are natural sources, such as collagen, gelatine, alginate, and chitosan, which are commonly used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Synthetic polymers are also used, including polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), which are US Food and Drug Administration-approved.

The choice of material largely depends on the intended application. For instance, synthetic materials are often chosen to enhance mechanical strength or to control degradation rates, particularly for applications like orthopaedic implants where scaffolds need to remain in the body longer. In contrast, natural materials are preferred when promoting cell attachment and growth is the priority.

**ScienceVega: So why did you decide to explore seaweed as an alternative to animal or synthetic-derived scaffolds?**

**GC:** Our interest in seaweed stemmed from sustainability. Seaweed is abundant in the oceans, so we hypothesised that it could provide a renewable source of biomaterials without harming animals or incurring the high costs associated with traditional scaffolds. Most scaffolds currently used in biomedical research are animal-derived, such as collagen and gelatine, which raises ethical concerns and can be prohibitively expensive.

For instance, collagen can cost thousands of dollars per gram. Scaling up production for larger tissues or preclinical trials becomes a significant challenge. Seaweed, on the other hand, is widely available and naturally rich in beneficial properties like antibacterial activity, antioxidant compounds, and structural porosity, making it an ideal candidate for supporting cell growth. Using seaweed allows us to develop cost-effective, ethical, and sustainable scaffolds.

**ScienceVega: What research did you conduct to support the idea that seaweed-derived scaffolds are viable?**

**GC:** In our recent study, we focused on a species called *Devaleraea mollis*, a red seaweed found in the northwestern coastal regions. This species is rich in natural polysaccharides and proteins, making it excellent for forming hydrogels that support cell growth. Additionally, it has a balanced composition that provides good mechanical properties, allowing us to process it into 3D scaffolds and fine-tune the structure as needed. 

While our research centred on this red seaweed, other species also have unique biochemical components like alginate or carrageenan, which could be optimised for different tissue applications. Exploring these options opens up new opportunities for designing functional, sustainable biomaterials.

**ScienceVega: What further research is required before seaweed-derived scaffolds can be used in preclinical or clinical settings?**

**GC:** Several key areas need attention. First, we need comprehensive biocompatibility and immunogenicity studies to ensure these materials are safe over the long term. Second, we must optimise their mechanical and biochemical properties to match the requirements of specific tissues, since each organ has unique needs.

Scaling up fabrication processes reproducibly is another major challenge, along with regulatory compliance to meet preclinical and clinical standards. Finally, *in vivo* animal studies are necessary to test how these scaffolds integrate with natural tissues and degrade over time. Once these aspects are validated, seaweed-derived scaffolds could become a truly sustainable alternative for clinical tissue engineering.

**ScienceVega: Can you give an estimate of how long it might be before these scaffolds are in use?**

**GC:** While it depends on several factors, I would estimate ten years before seaweed-derived scaffolds could see use in preclinical or clinical applications.

**ScienceVega: How might your findings reduce the need for animal testing?**

**GC:** Our research could significantly reduce animal testing, particularly in cardiac tissue engineering. By creating seaweed-derived scaffolds that support the growth and function of cells in a three-dimensional environment, we can develop realistic *in vitro* tissue models. These models allow us to study drug responses, tissue development, and disease mechanisms without relying on live animals.

While this approach may not replace all animal studies, it offers a safer, ethical, and scalable alternative for many experiments, especially in drug testing and tissue engineering.

**ScienceVega: Was the idea of reducing animal testing or providing a vegan-friendly option a driving factor in your research?**

**GC:** Absolutely. One of our main motivations was to reduce reliance on animal-derived materials in research. We wanted to create human-specific tissue models using stem cell technology, allowing for more accurate testing without involving animal products. Seaweed provides a vegan-friendly, sustainable alternative that can mimic human tissues closely, increasing the translational potential of discoveries from bench to bedside.

**ScienceVega: And the vegan aspect – is that just a happy coincidence because seaweed is a plant?**

**GC:** It is true that it naturally aligns with vegan principles, which is an added benefit. It wasn’t just a coincidence; it’s part of the ethical framework of our work.

**ScienceVega: Is there a market for vegan-friendly scaffolds?**

**GC:** Definitely. For example, in cellular agriculture and lab-grown meat, scaffolds are critical for creating structured, marbled products. Vegan-friendly scaffolds are particularly important for this market, which is already valued at over $1bn.

**ScienceVega: So seaweed-derived scaffolds represent both a scientific and ethical breakthrough.**

**GC:** Exactly. They are sustainable, vegan-friendly, and support human-specific tissue models. They reduce reliance on animal products, lower research costs, and offer better translational outcomes. It’s a win-win for science, ethics, and the environment.
